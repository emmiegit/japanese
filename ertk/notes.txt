# This file is not structured (yet), but eventually will become a
# TOML or JSON or something file which describes all of the ERTK
# notes in a format that can be automatically read from.
#
# Because I have a lot of notes, I am first going through and writing
# down my notes for various characters, and then after I see what
# requirements I have, I will then develop a format which satisfies them.

# I studied using the 2001 edition of Remembering the Kanji, but new
# students should use the 2011 edition. Unfortunately the Anki deck I
# was using was for the 2011 edition, so I did not benefit from the book
# on the "missing" characters.
#
# I have adapted my notes for the 2011 edition, but this is relevant context
# in case there are issues in my serialization that were not issues when
# I was originally going through this studying myself.
