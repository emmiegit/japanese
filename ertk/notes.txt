# This file is not structured (yet), but eventually will become a
# TOML or JSON or something file which describes all of the ERTK
# notes in a format that can be automatically read from.
#
# Because I have a lot of notes, I am first going through and writing
# down my notes for various characters, and then after I see what
# requirements I have, I will then develop a format which satisfies them.

# I studied using the 2001 edition (v4) of Remembering the Kanji, but new
# students should use the 2011 edition (v6). Unfortunately the Anki deck I
# was using was for the 2011 edition, so I did not benefit from the book
# on the "missing" characters.
#
# I have adapted my notes for the 2011 edition, but this is relevant context
# in case there are issues in my serialization that were not issues when
# I was originally going through this studying myself.

# I assume the student will proceed into studying RTK 3. However even
# if you only study RTK 1, this guide should be helpful.
#
# I also assume the student is able to read using kana. I am not saying
# that the student must be able to read kana perfectly, just that they
# are familar with the basics and in the process of getting off of r≈çmaji.

# Things to be careful of with RTK:
# - keywords are not meanings, they are keywords
# - RTK uses a serif font for kanji, which like the lowercase letter "a" in many fonts, is not how the character is actually written. reference a handwritten font for each character (which this guide does)
